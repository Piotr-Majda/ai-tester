Critical Bugs
1. Stale Market Data due to Authentication Failure
The Bug: The system is unable to ingest fresh market data because the API key for the data feed has expired. This is a critical failure because it means all financial calculations are being done on old, potentially incorrect data.
Expected "Path to Reproduce": The agent should trace the logs backward from the [CRITICAL] error to see the story:
The scheduled DataIngestion job begins.
It attempts to connect to the NYSE_DataFeed_API.
The connection fails with an [ERROR], explicitly stating the "API Key has expired".
The system retries multiple times, failing each time for the same reason.
After the final retry fails, the system logs the critical error and aborts the job.
2. Report Generation Fails due to Calculation Error
The Bug: A core feature, generating the 'Transaction Volume Q3' report, is completely broken by a TypeError during a calculation. This likely means some unexpected data (like a null value) is present in the database.
Expected "Path to Reproduce":
A user (analyst_jane) logs in and requests the 'Transaction Volume Q3' report.
The system fetches the transaction data from the database.
The AnalyticsEngine attempts to sum up the transaction amounts.
The engine encounters a TypeError and crashes because it tries to add a number to a NoneType value, which is impossible.
Minor Bugs
1. Slow Database Query
The Bug: A background job to pre-calculate risk exposure is taking too long because of a slow database query.
Expected "Path to Reproduce":
The AnalyticsEngine starts the 'Pre-calculate daily risk exposure' job.
The system then logs a [WARNING] for a "Slow query detected" and even provides the exact SQL query that is causing the problem.
2. Degraded Chart Rendering
The Bug: A report's chart is missing its stylesheet (.css file), so it renders as a plain, ugly table instead of a rich visualization.
Expected "Path to Reproduce":
A user (manager_sue) requests the 'Q3 Growth Projections' report.
The ReportGenerator logs a [WARNING] that the asset /charts/FancyChart.css could not be found.
The system then logs that it is falling back to a basic HTML table.
